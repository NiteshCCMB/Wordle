# Wordle
These are two scripts that I created to solve wordle.

1. The first script is interactive where it accepts list of allowed words. It guess words and then accept positional information from user which they get from the wordle website. https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html
2. The second script accepts list of words that needed to be guessed and list of words that are allowed guesses. It then try to guess each word from the first file and calculate accuracy of the guesses. Correct match within 6 guesses is success, else failure.
